## Setting Up the Development Environment

1. Ensure you have Java 21 or higher installed.
2. Install [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) for dependency management.
3. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/spring-boot-react-nextjs/spring-boot-global-exception-handling.git`
4. Navigate to the project directory: `cd spring-boot-global-exception-handling`
5. Import the project into your IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, etc.).
6. Run `mvn clean install` to install the dependencies.
7. Run the application using your IDE or with the command: `mvn spring-boot:run`.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations, and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent.
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the approval of at least one other developer, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
